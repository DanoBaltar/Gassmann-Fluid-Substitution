# Gassman-Fluid-Substitution
Python Jupyter Notebooks for applying Gassmann Fluid Substitution

This Python Jupyter notebook provides a simple step by step implementation of the Gassmann fluid substitution equations for porous media.

This specific version of the notebook has the following features:

- Homogenous saturation estimation
- Basic modelling for CO2 replacing water
- Parameters based on Groningen Rotliegend averages
- Empirical Brie average has also been added for a patchy estimation and can be controlled by the 'e' parameter
- Graphical display output
- Attribute output to an ascii comma separated variable file.

Gassmann Assumptions
- Rock is homogenous and isotropic
- Pore space is completely connected and saturated
- Pore pressures are equilibrated throughout the pore space
